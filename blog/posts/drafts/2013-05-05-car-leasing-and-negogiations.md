Pushy salesperson will ask, what will it take to get you to sign today?

When you're uncertain on what you want. what trim, what options, they'll say well, we're out of S model. well, we don't have cars with just base model.
This is the time when you say, well if you don't, I'm taking my business somewhere else. If you don't have any models I like, I'll go to other dealerships.
My salesperson became nervous and went to grab his manager.

The finance guy secretly told me. It was 11, I was reading over the leasing agreement. The numbers don't add up and I wanted an explanation. He told me its because the sales guy absorbed all the fees and stuff, so I literally walk out with down and monthly payment only. He said as far as he's concerned he's happy NOT to do the transaction because they have no profit margin and actually losing money. Sales guy is doing because its the beginning of the month and he hasn't sold anything yet. He went as far as to show me a comparison of another purchaser and comparing the fee differences. My b/o rate is 0 while the other guy is 0.5. That's the business and occupation tax. So now I know where to look on the computer screen for their profit margin. The other guy showed 1754. Mine showed -917
