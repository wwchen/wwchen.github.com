## Suggestions
- Use rubber band/bicycle inner tube to take up slop on each pair of rods
Raw quote:
    I've used several different ball joints, they all work fine so long as they fit. Some have a bit larger or smaller range of motion though.
    
    Here is a handy trick to take out slop, I've been doing this since I set mine up months ago.
    Find/buy a bicycle inner tube and slice it across to create six 3/8in (10mm) rings that look like fat rubber bands. I got the cheapest tube I could at Walmart. Place one band at each end, of each pair of rods. These bands will take up any slop that develops. Trick Laser rod end Zero Lash straps are the same thing (they have a good picture showing how they are used). http://www.tricklaser.com/Zero-Lash-Straps-RM-ZLASH.htm You can also use the rubber to make noise dampeners for the drive motors.
