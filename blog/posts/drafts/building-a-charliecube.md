I first learned about Charliecube when I visited Metrix. Seeing the color LEDs going through different patterns
is very mesmurizing, and I committed myself to building one. It would be my first hardware project, and I thought
it wouldn't be very difficult. It's just a lot of soldering, which I need practice with anyway.

Fortunately, the build steps have already been [http://aglick.com/charliecube.html](documented already),
so all I need to do is follow his footsteps. I thought about extending to 5x5 cube, but I decided to improvise after
I got the basics down.

Build of Materials
==================
- 64 Common cathode color LEDs. (I sourced on [http://www.ebay.com/itm/-/281111473484](eBay) - 100 pcs for $12)
- Steel wires (length and guage is dependent to your taste)
- Arduino
- Solder
- Plastic or wood

Tools and Equipment
===================
- Soldering iron
- Laser cutter


Throughout the building exercise, I wanted everything done consistently, and there were some challenges in doing so.
The 20 guage galvanized steel wire I bought came in spool. First trouble I encounted was straightening the wires.
My steel wire is too thick to straighten with just tension.

The day my LEDs arrived, I was so excited.
In the walkthrough I referenced, it doesn't m
